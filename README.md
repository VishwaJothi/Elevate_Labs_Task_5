# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using two machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest.
The dataset used is heart.csv, containing patient health attributes and a target column indicating disease presence.

🔧 Technologies Used

📈 Results Summary

Random Forest outperforms Decision Tree with higher accuracy and better generalization.

Important features include: chest pain type, thalach (max heart rate), oldpeak, and others.
